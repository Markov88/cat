            <p> 'The Bengal could never be called delicate. They’re athletes: agile and graceful with a strong, muscular
                body, as befits a cat who looks as if they belong in the jungle.

                Despite their wild appearance, Bengal cats are actually quite affectionate with their human families.
                That said, they also have high energy and a fun-loving, playful side. They want to stay active and need
                a home that can match their energy.

                If you can fulfill the Bengal’s need for exercise, you’ll have a smart, loving cat who can keep you on
                your toes.

                Read below for a complete list of Bengal cat breed characteristics!</p>
